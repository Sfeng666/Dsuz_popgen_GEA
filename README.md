## Environment setup

To set up the environment for above analyses, you could use conda:
```
conda env create -n environemnt_name --file environemnt_name.yml
```
Environment needed for each analysis is indicated in documentation of each analysis. Environmental package lists (`environemnt_name.yml`) for cross-platform install could be found under [this directory](conda_environment).

If you have not installed conda, run the following command:
```
# download miniconda
curl -sL \
  "https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh" > \
  "Miniconda3.sh"
```
```  
# install miniconda
bash Miniconda3.sh
```
